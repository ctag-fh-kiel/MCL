The following repository contains a functional Arduino Mega 2560 core and the MegaCommandLive firmware.

It is compatibile with the MegaCommand Arduino Shield and the Arduino IDE framework.

MIDI controller:

The updated repository contains numerous enhancements and fixes.

- In 2016 the core was adapted to compile with the ArduinoIDE and MegaCommand hardware design.
- In 2017 the core was modified to work alongside standard Arduino Code and Libraries.
- In 2018 the MegaCommandLive firmware was refactored in to c++ libraries and is now
part of the MIDICtrl framework.
