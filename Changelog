MCL 2.20 09/11/2018

###### IMPORTANT ######
   Projects created on older versions will not be compatible with MCL 2.20

Stable support for 8x Turbo.
-  Significant improvments to the MIDI code now makes 8x Turbo
   the most stable speed setting.

   Choose this speed on both ports for lowest sequencer jitter and
   fastest transmission times.

GUI overhaul:
-  Both the HD44780 and OLED display get significant updates to the GUI
   to accomadate Chain mode. This includes a complete redesign of the
   menu system.

   The GridPage has been completely redisgned for both displays.

   Screensaver added for OLED display (5 minutes delay)

Slot menu:


-  To access the Slot menu:

    OLED_DISPLAY:

       Shift2 button will open the Slot menu for the selected slot.

    HD44780 LCD:

       Hold Shift 2 button + Encoder Button [ 1 - 4] will open the Slot menu
       for visible slots [ 1 - 4 ].

-  Slot Menu has following options and selectable values:
    Chain: [ --, auto, manual, random ]
    Loops:  (0, 64)
    Row:    (0,127)
    Seq: [ --, merge ]
    Clear: [ --, YES ]
    Apply: (0,20)

    Chain (global setting):
     - auto: enables chain auto mode global setting
     - manual: enables chain manual mode global setting
     - random: enables chain random mode global setting

    Loops: specify how many times to loop track/slot

    Row: specify which row to load/jump to after n loops.

    Seq: merge slot's MD sequencer data in to the internal sequencer

    Clear: clear the select slot.

    Apply: apply the above changes to the next N slots upon exit of SlotMenu.

Chain Mode:

  Chain Mode is enabled through the SlotMenu, or Global Settings->Chain Mode
  menus.

  Chain Mode is an enhancement of the default MCL write mode. It works
  like an old school music tracker. Tracks from different rows can be chained
  together and made to load automatically.

  Previously, when 'writing tracks' the MD pattern data would be transmited to
  the MD, and the corresponding internal sequencer data would be loaded along side it.

  When chain mode is enabled, only the MegaCommand internal sequencer data is 
  loaded and used to sequencer the Machindrum. By performing all the MD sequencing 
  from the MegaCommand we can load tracks instantaneoulsy without any audible delay.
  In addition, individual tracks can be chained together to form complex sequences or
  songs.

  To use chain mode, you must first "merge" your MD pattern data in to the
  internal sequencer. To do this, you can enable the "auto-merge"
  setting in the MachineDrum global settings page. If auto-mege is enabled,
  any time you save a track to the MegaCommand, the MD sequencer data will be
  merged in to the internal sequencer track for that slot.

  The SlotMenu can also be used to merge sequencer data on specific slots or
  entire rows. (see slot menu above)

  Chain mode resembles an old school music tracker. From the slot menu
  you can set the duration for which a track should play by setting the number
  of loops. The row value specifies which row of the Grid the track should
  load next after it has completed.

  Chain mode can be configured in 1 of 4 ways [ --, auto, manual, random ]
  If Chain mode is disabled then the write page performs as per pervious
  versions.

  If Auto mode is selected. Tracks written through the WritePage,
  will automatically load other tracks based on their Loop and Row settings.

  If Manual mode is selected, tracks will only be loaded through the Write
  page. (Useful if you want to pause the chaining functionality)

  If Random mode is chosen, tracks will automatically load based on random
  loop and row settings limited by parameter range in Global->ChainMode menu.

  When Chain mode is activated, the Write Page now displays "Chain".
  The quantization options behave slightly differently in Chain mode.
  In Chain mode, tracks will start playing from step 0 based on the
  step quanitzation.

GridPage Changes:

  If chain mode is active:

  The current active slot will blink.

  On the OLED display, the current Bar:Beat is dispicted.
  The next transition Bar:Beat is displayed below this.

BugFixes:

Numerous bug fixes and enhancements. See the git log

MCL 2.16a 10/08/2018

Hotfix:

Write original would be broken in some scenarios.

MCL 2.16 08/08/2018

Changes:

Improvements to the behaviour of Parameter Locks.

- Track parameters with paramter locks now have their correct default
  values detected. The default value is restored when the sequencer is
  stopped, or on next trig without a lock.

  Previously, saving the current kit or writing track to the current
  pattern would incorrectly cause the 'default' parameter value to change
  to the last parameter lock value sent.

SeqStepPage:

- TrigLocks are now cleared when a trig is set, not when a trig is deleted.

Bug fixes:

- MDExploit track switching improved.

MCL 2.15 01/08/2018

##### Important #######

OLED Display is now the default display type.
- See Readme on how to enable HD44780 LCD

- Grid Write and Save Pages GUI changes:
  Precision mode is now enabled by holding shift1 button in either page.
  Shift2 button will "write/save" original, which means all tracks and master
  settings.
  Encoder buttons no longer save or write tracks.

Kit auto-save enabled by default.

- If auto-save is enabled and the sequencer is stopped, the current kit will be
  saved when entering sub pages. This is necessary to detect kit changes
  such as machine change, or masterfx changes.

- Current kit is saved when storing track from the MD when autosave is
  enabled.
- Current kit is always saved when writing tracks to the MD regardless of
  autosave setting.

- SystemConfig updated requiring new Project Creation on startup.

Stability:

- Minimum sequencer jitter and best overall firmware performance is acheived
  when Turbo Midi is set to 4x. 8x turbo may not provide any performance
  benefit.

MD SDS Bug:

- If MD sysex data is requested at a time proceeding a sample request,
  the MD encoders and trigs lock up indefinately after the sample is received.
  The only current workaround is to power cycle the MD after receiving a sample.

##### Features Added #####

Quick PageSelect:

- Holding Shift Button 1 now accesses a page quick select menu.

- When inside the page select menu:
  MD trigger buttons 1 -> 16 can be used to select various pages quickly.
  Rotary encoder 1 can be used to scroll through available pages.
  Releasing Shift Button 1 enters the selected page.

- Currently (Mute, Mixer, Cue and Wav Designer) pages are accessible through
  this menu.

Wav Designer.

- Accessible from QuickPageselect menu above.

- 3 Oscillator Additive Synthesiser. Generates single cycle waveforms and sends
  them to a MD sample slot.

- There are 4 pages to the WavDesigner.
  Encoder buttons[1-3] select the indivdual oscillators.
  Oscillator Pages:
    - Oscillator wavform can be changed by pressing top left button repeteadly.
    Oscillator WAV Forms:
	  - SIN: Sine wav with adjustable overtones (each overtone is an octave above
        fundamental)
      - TRI
      - PULSE
      - SAW
      - USR: User defined waveform, 16 points with linear interpolation.

    - The MD trigger interface together with encoder 4 can be used to
      manipulate the SIN and USR waveforms.
    - Encoder 1 pitch adjusts frequency by semitone.
    - Encoder 2 is fine tune +-100 Cents
    - Encoder 3 is pulse width.

  Oscillator Mixer Page:
    - The wav designer mixer page has volume levels for each of the oscillators.

	- From the mixer page, top right button can be used to render and transmit the waveform.
      (Some of the  MD GUI will lock up when receiving samples, see bug description
	  above)
	- Encoders 1-3 adjust oscillator volume
	- Encoder 4 adjusts MSD destination sample slot.

Mute Page:

- A replacement for the MD mute menu. This features quantisation modes.
  Also LVL function sets the track(s) volume to 0 before unmuting, mixer
  page can then be used to fade in the track(s) gently.
- MCL will attempt to detect the current mute state. (No way of receiving it
from the MD)

Mixer Page:

-  For OLED users this will depict both mutes and levels.
-  Track triggering is displayed visually.
-  Holding Write Button when pressing MD trigs will toggle mutes according
   to settings in the Mute Page.

Chromatic mode:

- Chromatic mode will be functional from pages outside of PTC page.

- MD POLYSTART parameter added. When a POLYSTART value is chosen, Tracks
  from (POLYSTART to POLYSTART + POLYMAX) will be locked in as chromatic
  tracks. Playable from most pages if an external keyboard is attached.

- When modifying paramters from a chromatic track, the corresponding parameter
  on remaing poly tracks are updated simultanously.

Display Mirror:

- When enabled, the MC will transmit a 7bit encoded dump of the display over
  usb-serial which can be viewed using the mc_display_mirror.py script.

Midi Forward:

- Ability to forward all MIDI messages (except clock/realtime) to alternate
  port. Useful if you want to use the MD with the MC and an attached controller.

Enhancements Bug Fixes + Changes:

- Sample Support.
  MidiSDS sample format send/rec supported. Used for Wav designer.
  WAV file library has been added. should support 8->24bit samples multi
  channel.

- OLED SPI frequency doubled. Noticed that the default SPI speed for the OLED
  library was only 4Mhz. Increased to 8MHz. Might provide a small improvement
  to refresh rate.

- Re-drawing of display is disabled in Live Record mode when sequencer running.
  To improve MIDI input latency the OLED display is only updated when changing
  paramter values. This greatly reduces MIDI latency during live record mode.

- Mixer page encoder behaviour improved. large jumps in encoder values are
  supported and midi CC messages are interpolated between to give smooth
  value change.

- Chromatic mode extended to the Seq Step page. Encoder 4 is used to
  select Note of current step (uses one parameter lock track)
  External MIDI keyboard on port 2 can also be used to set note value.

- Improvement of Sequencer GUI. Parameter changes are now applied immediately
  upon encoder change.

- ExtSeqPage had some GUI problems. Fixed.

- Improvement to Project page GUI. Can now exit load and new project
pages. New project page shows a blinking cursor for the current character
select.

- GridWrite Page P+/P- modes were broken.

- GridWrite Page: When writing: If MD track length is shorter than the current pattern
  length, the selected tracks will automatically loop until they fill up the remaining
  pattern steps.

- Sequencer stability improvement, no more missing notes.

- Sequencer Track Length adjustment fixes.

- Improvements to sequencer parameter locks and pitch handling.

- Macros to control MD GUI.
  Discovered undocumented sysex commands that allow for controlling of MD GUI.
  Used to exit menus and record mode in the MD before enabling Trigger Exploit.

- Various improvements to the Trigger Exploit.

- Changes to ActivePeering for better connectivty and device identificaiton.

- Various other improvements I can't remember. See GitLog.
