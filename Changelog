MCL 2.15 4/07/2018

Important:

Kit auto-save enabled by default.

- For MCL to work correctly you need to enable "MD Save: Auto" from the
system/options page. The current kit will be saved when entering sub pages.
This is necessary to obtain the current state of the MD.

SystemConfig updated requiring new Project Creation on startup.

- Mute mask was added to the system config. Any changes to the system config
 layout require a new project to be created on first boot. Old projects are
 still compatible and can be loaded from the 'Load Project' menu.

MD SDS Bug:

- If MD sysex data is requested at a time proceeding a sample request,
the MD encoders and trigs lock up indefinately after the sample is received. The only
workaround is to use the WavDesigner pages without accessing other MCL pages.

Features Added:

Quick PageSelect

- Shift Button 2 now accesses a page quick select menu.
MD trigger buttons 1 -> 16 can be used to select various pages quickly.
Alternatively rotary encoder 1 can be used to scroll through available pages.
Currently (Mute, Mixer, Cue and Wav Designer) pages are accessible through
this menu.

Wav Designer.

3 Oscillator Additive Synthesiser. Generates single cycle waveforms and sends
them to a MD sample slot.

Sample Support.

MidiSDS sample format send/rec supported. Used for Wav designer.
WAV file library has been added. should support 8->24bit samples multi
channel.

Mute Page

A replacement for the MD mute menu. This features quantisation modes.
Also LVL function sets the track(s) volume to 0 before unmuting, mixer
page can then be used to fade in the track(s) gently.

Mixer Page:

For OLED users this will depict both mutes and levels.
Track triggering is displayed visually.

Chromatic mode:

Chromatic mode will be functional from pages outside of PTC page.

MD POLYSTART parameter added. When a POLYSTART value is chosen, Tracks
from (POLYSTART to POLYSTART + POLYMAX) will be locked in as chromatic
tracks. Playable from most pages if an external keyboard is attached.

Display Mirror:

When enabled, the MC will transmit a 7bit encoded dump of the display over
usb-serial which can be viewed using the mc_display_mirror.py script.

Midi Forward:

Ability to forward all MIDI messages (except clock/realtime) to alternate
port. Useful if you want to use the MD with the MC and an attached controller.

Enhancements Bug Fixes:

- OLED SPI frequency doubled. Noticed that the default SPI speed for the OLED
library was only 4Mhz. Increased to 8MHz. Might provide a small improvement
to refresh rate.

- Re-drawing of display is disabled in Live Record mode when sequencer running.
To improve MIDI input latency the OLED display is only updated when changing
paramter values. This greatly reduces MIDI latency during live record mode.

- Mixer page encoder behaviour improved. large jumps in encoder values are
supported and midi CC messages are interpolated between to give smooth
value change.

- Chromatic mode extended to the Seq Step page. Encoder 4 is used to
select Note of current step (uses one parameter lock track)
External MIDI keyboard on port 2 can also be used to set note value.

- Improvement of Sequencer GUI. Parameter changes are now applied immediately
upon encoder change. Current step is now depicted more accurately, would 
previously lag behind some ms.

- Improvement to Project page GUI. Can now exit load and new project
pages. New project page shows a blinking cursor for the current character
select.

- GridWrite Page P+/P- modes were broken.

- GridWrite Page: If MD track length is shorter than the pattern length, the
tracks will automatically loop until they fill up the remaining pattern steps.

- Grid Write and Save Pages GUI changes:
  Precision mode is now enabled by holding shift1 or shift2 buttons.
  Encoder buttons no longer save or write tracks and instead exit the pages
   as per standard function.
